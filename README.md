Concept: To be able to compare ride fares in order for user to determine the optimal option.

User Story: As a user, filling out your location and destination and then waiting in order to see prices, eta, etc. populate for various car choices can be tedious. By utilizing this app, a user will be able to input their location and destination with easy dragable pins. From there, once the search button is hit, the costs for each type of car option provided will populate. Currently, this project is linked to Lyft's API which means a user is able to view the price options for a lyft, lyft-line, and lyft-plus. The benefit to this is convenience/one-stop-shop, weighing out whether the slight price difference makes a lyft over lyft-line a better option, as well as having the ability to determine whether a plus will be the cheaper option over calling multiple cars if you are with your group of friends. In the future, a user will also be able to see Uber prices & yellow cab prices populate as well.
